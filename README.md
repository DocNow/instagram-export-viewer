# instagram-export-viewer
Instagram’s “Data Download” lets users export their photos, videos, archived Stories, profile, info, comments, and non-ephemeral messages as  bunch of json files. However, Instgram does not provide an index.html for simple viewing of the export. 

## PROTOTYPE

## Usage
Place the index.html file in the root directory of your instagram export and open it in a web browser. For standalone use, please use firefox, IE and Chrome need the json files to be served by a webserver.
